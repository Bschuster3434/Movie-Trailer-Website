Movie Trailer Website
by Brian Schuster
Created on April 9th, 2015

This website is a dynamically created movie poster website,
created for the 'Programming Foundations with Python' course
on Udacity.com.

The original site is designed to present of a list of pre-defined
movies and allow you to 'click' on a movie poster and show a film.
I will be modifying this base template in the following ways:

- Adding multiple categories of films via a menu at the top, and
  populating each group with their own genre (documentary, drama,
  animated films)
- Adding a link to the amazon page to allow for the purchase of
  the film from amazon.com
- Adding a UI Page to allow for dynamically adding films to the
  list without having to interact with the programming language
  directly
